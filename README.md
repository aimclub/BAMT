## Introduction

BAMT - Bayesian Analytical and Modelling Toolkit. This repository contains a data modeling and analysis tool based on Bayesian networks. It can be divided into two main parts - algorithms for constructing and training Bayesian networks on data and algorithms for applying Bayesian networks for filling gaps, generating synthetic data, assessing edge strength, etc.

## Installation

BAMT package is available via PyPi:

```bash
pip install bamt
```

## BAMT Features

The following algorithms for Bayesian Networks learning are implemented:

- Building the structure of a Bayesian network based on expert knowledge by directly specifying the structure of the network.
- Building the structure of a Bayesian network on data using three algorithms - Hill Climbing, evolutionary, and PC (PC is currently under development). For Hill Climbing, the following score functions are implemented - MI, K2, BIC, AIC. The algorithms work on both discrete and mixed data.
- Learning the parameters of distributions in the nodes of the network based on Gaussian distribution and Mixture Gaussian distribution with automatic selection of the number of components.
- Non-parametric learning of distributions at nodes using classification and regression models.
- BigBraveBN - algorithm for structural learning of Bayesian networks with a large number of nodes. Tested on networks with up to 500 nodes.

### Difference from existing implementations:

- Algorithms work on mixed data.
- Structural learning implements score-functions for mixed data.
- Parametric learning implements the use of a mixture of Gaussian distributions to approximate continuous distributions.
- Non-parametric learning of distributions with various user-specified regression and classification models.
- The algorithm for structural training of large Bayesian networks (> 10 nodes) is based on local training of small networks with their subsequent algorithmic connection.

For example, in terms of data analysis and modeling using Bayesian networks, a pipeline has been implemented to generate synthetic data by sampling from Bayesian networks.

## How to use

Then the necessary classes are imported from the library:

```python
from bamt.networks.hybrid_bn import HybridBN
```

Next, a network instance is created and training (structure and parameters) is performed:

```python
bn = HybridBN(has_logit=False, use_mixture=True)
bn.add_edges(preprocessed_data)
bn.fit_parameters(data)
```

## Examples & Tutorials

More examples can be found in [Documentation](https://bamt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/learn_save.html).

## Project structure

The latest stable version of the library is available in the master branch.

It includes the following modules and directories:

- [bamt](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/bamt) - directory with the framework code:
    - Preprocessing - module for data preprocessing
    - Networks - module for building and training Bayesian networks
    - Nodes - module for nodes support of Bayesian networks
    - Utilities - module for mathematical and graph utilities
- [data](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/data) - directory with data for experiments and tests
- [tests](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/tests) - directory with unit and integration tests
- [tutorials](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/tutorials) - directory with tutorials
- [docs](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/docs) - directory with RTD documentation

### Preprocessing

Preprocessor module allows users to transform data according to the pipeline (similar to the pipeline in scikit-learn).

### Networks

Three types of networks are implemented:

- HybridBN - Bayesian network with mixed data
- DiscreteBN - Bayesian network with discrete data
- ContinuousBN - Bayesian network with continuous data

They are inherited from the abstract class BaseNetwork.

### Nodes

Contains classes for nodes of Bayesian networks.

### Utilities

Utilities module contains mathematical and graph utilities to support the main functionality of the library.
