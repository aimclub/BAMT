**********************
Greedy Hill-Climbing
for Structure Learning
**********************

Code for Searching through the space of
possible Bayesian Network structures.

Various optimization procedures are employed,
from greedy search to simulated annealing, and 
so on - mostly using scipy.optimize.

Local search - possible moves:
- Add edge
- Delete edge
- Invert edge

Strategies to improve Greedy Hill-Climbing:
- Random Restarts
    - when we get stuck, take some number of
    random steps and then start climbing again.
- Tabu List
    - keep a list of the K steps most recently taken,
    and say that the search cannt reverse (undo) any
    of these steps.

    """
    Greedy Hill Climbing search proceeds by choosing the move
    which maximizes the increase in fitness of the
    network at the current step. It continues until
    it reaches a point where there does not exist any
    feasible single move that increases the network fitness.

    It is called "greedy" because it simply does what is
    best at the current iteration only, and thus does not
    look ahead to what may be better later on in the search.

    For computational saving, a Priority Queue (python's heapq) 
    can be used	to maintain the best operators and reduce the
    complexity of picking the best operator from O(n^2) to O(nlogn).
    This works by maintaining the heapq of operators sorted by their
    delta score, and each time a move is made, we only have to recompute
    the O(n) delta-scores which were affected by the move. The rest of
    the operator delta-scores are not affected.

    For additional computational efficiency, we can cache the
    sufficient statistics for various families of distributions - 
    therefore, computing the mutual information for a given family
    only needs to happen once.

    The possible moves are the following:
        - add edge
        - delete edge
        - invert edge

    Arguments
    ---------
    *data* : a nested numpy array
        The data from which the Bayesian network
        structure will be learned.

    *metric* : a string
        Which score metric to use.
        Options:
            - AIC
            - BIC / MDL
            - LL (log-likelihood)

    *max_iter* : an integer
        The maximum number of iterations of the
        hill-climbing algorithm to run. Note that
        the algorithm will terminate on its own if no
        improvement is made in a given iteration.

    *debug* : boolean
        Whether to print(the scores/moves of the)
        algorithm as its happening.

    *init_nodes* : a list of initialize nodes (number of nodes according to the dataset)

    *restriction* : a list of 2-tuples
        For MMHC algorithm, the list of allowable edge additions.

    Returns
    -------
    *bn* : a BayesNet object
